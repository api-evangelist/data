<p>Google’s announcement of its new Google Container Engine, a managed service version of its open-sourced Kubernetes container-management system, shows that the search giant believes it can lure new customers to its cloud through its container expertise.But, it’s clear from talking to various attendees at Google’s Cloud Platform event that while many people are interested in an enterprise-version of Kubernetes, questions of container security, ease of use on different cloud platforms and stability need to be ironed out before folks are ready to sign up.Although the service is only available in alpha, meaning that it’s being tested to see whether it can handle mass adoption, it’s obvious that Google is targeting enterprise clients who might be wary of trying out open-source products.Greg DeMichillie, Google’s director of product management for its cloud platform made it clear that Google feels containers “are the center of disruption” when it comes to modern-day computing and application development; if you are a company that’s not on top of current trends, you risk falling to the wayside as the airline industry did during the 1980s when it came to PCs, he said during the keynote.Google wants to show the enterprise world that it can trust it when it comes to container technology, and DeMichillie mentioned at several points how Google engineers helped create control groups (or, “cgroups”), a feature of the Linux kernel that distributes operating system resources to a container.</p>
