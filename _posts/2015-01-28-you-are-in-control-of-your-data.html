<p>Thanks to Cory Doctorow for sharing our provider guide again this week, which showcases the data that consumers might share using social login through Facebook and other identity providers.Especially because today is international Data Privacy Day, and also because Cory made it seem that sharing this data “just happens,” I wanted to clarify some common misconceptions about social login: what’s shared, what isn’t, and how Janrain manages the data opt-in process for marketers in order to create better customer experiences.Individuals have all the control
Ultimately, when it comes to social login, you have all the control.When a consumer chooses Facebook to login, all of the data passed to the site is based on that consumer opting-in.This is really fundamentally different than how most consumer data is collected.</p>
