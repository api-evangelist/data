<p>If you are consuming long-form content on the internet, chances are you are doing it on WordPress.Currently 20% of all websites and 50% of the top 1000 websites are run on the content management system and the platform is home to sites ranging from Time and TechCrunch to individually-hosted blogs (including many written by DataSift employees).I’m a rabid consumer of content published on WordPress and I especially appreciate articles that are engaging and germane to my unique interests like TED.com (you’ll find some visionary content here if you’re not already looking) and bothsidesofthetable.com where I find inspiration from one of the great leaders in tech, Mark Suster (full disclosure, Mark is on our board).</p>
