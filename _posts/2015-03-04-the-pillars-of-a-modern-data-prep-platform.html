<p>– Nenshad Bardoliwalla, Co-founder and VP of Products for Paxata, says:
The five pillars of a modern data prep platform – performance, elasticity, efficiency, connectivity and scalability – all underscore the need for a solution that can deliver interactive performance on data preparation tasks at massive volumes.Elasticity should be achieved through a utility-based model that dynamically scales costs and capacity up or down as workloads and users increase or decrease.Efficiencies are gained by performing massive data prep projects with no coding, sampling or pre-defined models required.Connectivity options should provide seamless access to machine and interaction data stored in Hadoop clusters and relational databases.Finally, scalability needs to be addressed through automation of data prep tasks, project repeatability and data extraction with a new REST API toolkit.</p>
