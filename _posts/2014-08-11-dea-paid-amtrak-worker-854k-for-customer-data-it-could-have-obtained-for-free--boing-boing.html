<p>A former Amtrak employee has been selling passenger data to the DEA for almost twenty years, and the individual received about $854K for their efforts.But the DEA could have obtained information relevant to the agencys work for free.The ill-gotten data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, names, credit card numbers, and itineraries, and was provided by an employee described as a secretary to a train and engine crew, according to AP.The employee was not publicly identified except as a secretary to a train and engine crew in a report on the incident by Amtraks inspector general.The secretary was allowed to retire, rather than face administrative discipline, after the discovery that the employee had effectively been acting as an informant who regularly sold private passenger information since 1995 without Amtraks approval, according to a one-paragraph summary of the matter.</p>
