<p>Humans are social creatures.That might even be truer when we go online.Consider the following recent (beginning portion of 2014) statistics about the most popular social network and blog platforms and their memberships:
Twitter has 560 million registered users, and over half of them are active, and at least as of a couple of years ago, there were 200 million tweets sent every single day.WordPress powers 20% of the top global sites and adds 40 million posts per month.While Disqusâ€™ commenting engine claims 1 billion monthly unique users.</p>
