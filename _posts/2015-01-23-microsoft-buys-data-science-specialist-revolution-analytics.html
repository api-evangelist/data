<p>Microsoft has agreed to acquire Revolution Analytics, a company built around commercial software and support for the popular R statistical computing project.The open source R project is hugely popular among data scientists and research types, and having Revolution’s R experts in-house could be a big deal for Microsoft as it tries to establish itself as the go-to place for data science software.Among Revolution’s additions to the standard R capabilities were simplifying the use of the program and engineering it to run across big data systems such as Hadoop.Here’s how Joseph Sirosh, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for machine learning, explains what the deal means in a blog post:
As their volumes of data continually grow, organizations of all kinds around the world – financial, manufacturing, health care, retail, research – need powerful analytical models to make data-driven decisions.This requires high performance computation that is “close” to the data, and scales with the business’ needs over time.</p>
