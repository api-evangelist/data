<p>This morning, Pivotal and Hortonworks announced the formation of the Open Data Platform Initiative.Cloudera has elected not to join, and I’d like to explain why.I have an engineer’s disdain for industry consortia in general, and for vendor-driven consortia in particular.Far too often, these organizations aim not at promoting, but rather at slowing, innovation in the technology industry.I am old enough to have witnessed the creation of the Open Software Foundation first-hand.</p>
