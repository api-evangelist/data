<p>In Crowdsourcing local data the right way I envisioned a different way for businesses to register with state governments.In this model, state governments invite and encourage businesses to be the authoritative sources for their own data, and to announce URLs at which that data is published in standard formats.Instead of plugging data into the stateâ€™s website, a business would transmit an URL.The state would sync the data at that URL, assign it a version number, and verify its copy (tethered to the URL) as an approved version.The state would also certify the URL as a source of additional data not required by the state but available from the business at that URL.</p>
