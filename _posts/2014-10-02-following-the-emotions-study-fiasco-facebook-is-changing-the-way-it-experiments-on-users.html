<p>Hot on the heels of its sweeping apology to the LGBT community, Facebook has apologized to its users for conducting emotional experiments on them.You may recall that back in June, the social media site found itself in hot water for conducting a study in which it filled some users’ news feeds with positive posts and some with negative posts to see whether it impacted the tone of these people’s subsequent posts.It was essentially a test of emotion virality.The backlash from that study caught Facebook by surprise and it scrambled to respond to its users’ anger at becoming de facto guinea pigs.It was an important learning moment for the company.</p>
