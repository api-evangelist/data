<p>Datafiniti, a startup that wants to apply search to big data applications, has rejiggered the technology behind its 80legs web crawler and moved to the cloud.With its new system, CEO and founder Shion Deysarkar claims that a user can scan every single homepage on the internet in roughly a week and then load that data into whatever database he may be using.Although there’s a lot of information out in the internet that could be useful for an organization to harness — Yelp reviews, websites with customer feedback information, etc.— unless a company has a lot of man-power, it’s difficult to be able to take all of that data and make it presentable.That’s where 80legs comes in.</p>
