<p>The data protection authorities of the German city of Hamburg are the latest to order Google to clean up its act on privacy.Hamburg privacy regulator Johannes Caspar said Tuesday that, last week, he ordered Google to “take the necessary technical and organisational measures to guarantee that their users can decide on their own if and to what extend their data is used for profiling.” Google said in a statement that it is “now studying their order to determine next steps.”
Google’s unified privacy policy lets the firm share users’ personal information across services from Gmail to YouTube, in order to profile users in more detail so Google can make more money off ads.EU data protection law states that users must consciously opt into such sharing in an informed way, based on clear information about what data goes where.</p>
