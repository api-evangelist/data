<p>An application is more than source code - it’s executables, generated assets, runtime environments, dependencies, configuration, running processes, backing services and more.What if you could fork your entire app, not just your code?lets you create unique, running instances of existing applications right from the command line.These instances are live and available on Heroku immediately so you can change, scale and share them however you want.How It Works
  You can fork apps you own and apps you’re collaborating on.</p>
