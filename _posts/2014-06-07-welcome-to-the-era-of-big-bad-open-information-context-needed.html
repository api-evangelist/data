<p>With the amount of data we are generating, we should be thinking about information overload.What will it look like when we have 50 billion devices connected to the Internet and contributing to an already large the data set?Will we eventually be able to extract any useful information?If big data is on course to transform business and society, then open data has a role to play to make sure information is accessible and shared.And as we make data open we also need to consider adding context.</p>
