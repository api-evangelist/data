<p>There are about as many uses for Factual’s dataset as there are data points.Today, we leveraged this power to solve one of life’s more important questions: which is more popular – New York or Chicago style pizza?To find the truth, we cracked open our Restaurants Data 1 and took a look at how many pizza spots in the US label themselves as providers of thin crust or deep dish. To compare the popularity of the two culinary approaches, we queried all restaurants serving pizza in the US, with either “New York” or “Chicago” in their names2. Though this metric may underestimate the absolute number of establishments serving New York or Chicago style pizza, it gives us a strong idea of the perceived popularity of each (we assume that owners chose to include pizza style in their restaurant names because they know it appeals to their customers).</p>
