<p>When using the word ephemeral, its hard not to think of Snapchat these days, however the concept applies to the on demand computing pattern we promote here at Iron.io with our task processing service IronWorker.At a glance, each Docker container in which a task runs is only alive for the duration of the process itself, providing a highly effective environment for powering applications that follow the microservices architectural style.As Docker continues to spread through the industry by promising a standardized, encapsulated runtime across any environment, an entire ecosystem has emerged around containers from their orchestration to their hosting.We were early adopters with our initial use case, and continue to further leverage the technology through multi-cloud deployments and integrations.</p>
