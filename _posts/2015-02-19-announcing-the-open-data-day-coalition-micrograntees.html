<p>Two weeks back a coalition of Open Data Day supporters announced a micro-grant scheme in an open call for groups with good ideas for Open Data Day activities.The response was overwhelming and over 75 groups from all corners of the world found the time to send in an application for one of the 300 USD micro-grants.We were absolutely overwhelmed with the number of applications and sadly could only reward a small fraction of them, despite the vast majority being more than worthy of financial support.Through dire deliberations the following groups were selected:
We, the coalition behind the micro-grants, congratulate them all and look forward to help them alongside all other groups organizing Open Data Day activities.For all the groups who were unfortunately not awarded funds this time around, we were still tremendously excited to read about their plans.</p>
