<p>Hi, I’m Nikhil Palekar, and I run the Solutions group at FoundationDB.Recently, we’ve had lots of customers reach out to us to discuss modeling time-series data in FoundationDB, so I thought I would write a quick blog post about time-series data and how it fits into FoundationDB.What is time-series data?Modern applications generate huge amounts of “event”-based data organized by the timestamp of when the event occurred.Sensor data, call or SMS data, network monitoring or analytics data, and financial applications all have time components, and data can be generated in huge volumes as automated “events” occur in connected networks and systems.</p>
