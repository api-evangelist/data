Financial information services company Thomson Reuters has revealed plans to open-source the identifier system it developed to index every listed company in the world.Having grown through acquisition over the years, Thomson Reuters developed the identifier system to bridge and make sense of the multiple silos of data that it developed or has access to.The company takes in data from 1400-plus sources worldwide.In order to turn those silos into an accessible content marketplace that could then be analysed for insights, Thomson Reuters developed a standard ontology that establishes a permanent identifier for every piece of data, using a 256-bit code to identify every company in the world.That capability has already been implemented in the Accelus Org ID system currently used by a handful of organisations worldwide, including one Australian bank.</p>
