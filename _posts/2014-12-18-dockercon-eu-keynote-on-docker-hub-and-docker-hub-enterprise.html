<p>This post covers the second half of the DockerCon EU evening keynote on December 4th.While the first part of the keynote focused on the Docker platform’s new orchestration services, the 2nd part focuses on Docker Hub, its new features as well as Docker Hub Enterprise which was announced during the conference.For your convenience, we’ve divided the keynote into four discrete sections:
1.Introduction to Docker Hub by Scott Johnston
2.The future of Docker Hub by Justen Stepka
3.</p>
