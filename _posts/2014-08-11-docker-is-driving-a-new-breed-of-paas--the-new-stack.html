<p>Platform as a service technology has been around for years now.The first breed, like Azure and Heroku, delivered the service for users.Then came the likes of Cloud Foundry and OpenShift, designed to let users run their own PaaS – either on-premises or in the public cloud of their choosing.Now, a third wave of PaaS is emerging.The efforts, like Deis, Flynn, Tsuru, Dawn and Octohost have some similarities with the second generation PaaS initiatives like Cloud Foundry and Openshift – namely, they’re open source and designed to let users run their own PaaS.</p>
