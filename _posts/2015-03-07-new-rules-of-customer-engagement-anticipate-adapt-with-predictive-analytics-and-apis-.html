<p>In the last few years, the rules of customer engagement have changed completely.This is due, in part, to the fact that customers can engage with brands in an unprecedented number of ways on a dizzying array of platforms, devices, and applications.For example, we might receive an offer via email, view the details on a smartphone, then visit a nearby store to touch the product.After that, we might go home and research a little more online, maybe engaging in a chat session with a customer service agent or checking out what our social networks say about the product—all before making the purchase on our tablet.For companies to remain relevant and competitive in this age of hyper-connectivity, a deep understanding of individual customer journeys—that is, the sequence of all interactions across a wide range of channels—will be a baseline necessity for predicting and satisfying individual needs.</p>
