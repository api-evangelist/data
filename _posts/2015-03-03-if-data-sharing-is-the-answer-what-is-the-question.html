<p>Christine L.Borgman at ERCIM News: â€œData sharing has become policy enforced by governments, funding agencies, journals, and other stakeholders.Arguments in favor include leveraging investments in research, reducing the need to collect new data, addressing new research questions by reusing or combining extant data, and reproducing research, which would lead to greater accountability, transparency, and less fraud.Arguments against data sharing rarely are expressed in public fora, so popular is the idea.Much of the scholarship on data practices attempts to understand the socio-technical barriers to sharing, with goals to design infrastructures, policies, and cultural interventions that will overcome these barriers.</p>
