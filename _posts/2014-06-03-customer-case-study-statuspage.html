<p>Customer Case Study: StatusPage                  
TempoDB has allowed us to scale … it’s let us focus our time and energy on the experience our customers have.” 
- Scott Klein, Founder, StatusPage 
Overview: 
StatusPage prides itself on being a communication tool to help increase transparency for SaaS and infrastructure-based Internet companies.We would all love it if our websites never went down or had problems, but the reality is that sometimes issues arise.When they do, communication can be the key that makes or breaks customer satisfaction.StatusPage allows their customers to have that communication with their users.</p>
