<p>Progress today announced expanded capabilities for its leading DataDirect Cloud data integration solution with new support for the Open Data Protocol (OData), a data access protocol for querying and updating data.This new capability makes it simple to interact with data from a variety of applications and programming languages so it’s easier to consume by both information workers and developers from any platform or device.As businesses look to facilitate access to their wealth of data, OData provides the ideal means to standardize the link between applications and the broad spectrum of enterprise data sources.Because it is built on standards such as REST and JSON, OData makes it easy for mobile, enterprise mobile, SaaS, Web, and PaaS applications to access data from sources such as Salesforce, DB2, Oracle and SQL Server.Much like ODBC and JDBC have done to standardize data connectivity, OData is quickly becoming the standard protocol of choice for mobile and cloud apps in the increasingly agile enterprise.</p>
