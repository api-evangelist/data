<p>arAmazon Web Services is working on some form of Docker support to be revealed at AWS Re:Invent last week.How do we know this?Because Jeff Barr, AWS evangelist, tweeted this on November 3:
AWS Re:Invent officially kicks off on November 11.Containers are an emerging alternative to virtualized machines (VMs), and AWS is pretty much founded on the heavy use of VMs, so this could raise eyebrows.But perceived performance and efficiency advantages of containers versus VMs is driving change across the industry.</p>
