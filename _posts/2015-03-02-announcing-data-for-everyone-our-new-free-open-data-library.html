<p>We think that open data is the new open source.We know data has become as important as software for many applications.And while there is lots of open-source software available, there are almost no good sources of open data.Today, by releasing large, high quality, real world data sets collected by our customers and published with their permission, weâ€™re trying to change that.For example, say you tried to create a search engine.</p>
