<p>School of Data is re-publishing Noah Veltman‘s Learning Lunches, a series of tutorials that demystify technical subjects relevant to the data journalism newsroom.This Learning Lunch is about cleaning up data: what to do and, more importantly, what not to do.One of the most important and oft-neglected steps in any data journalism project is cleaning up raw data.Almost always, when you first get the data you want (or the data you’ve settled for), it’s not yet usable.It’s riddled with inconsistencies and doesn’t express the relationships you want to analyze.</p>
