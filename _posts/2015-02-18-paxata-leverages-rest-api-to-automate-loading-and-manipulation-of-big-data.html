<p>Rather than continuing to rely on traditional extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools to get data into Big Data applications running on Hadoop, Paxata at the Strata + Hadoop 2015 conference today unfurled an update to its software that lets organizations use a REST API to load data.Nenshad Bardoiwalla, vice president of products for Paxata, says the spring 2015 release of Adaptive Data Preparation platform from Paxata leverages a RESTful API to enable data scientists and other users to load data into the application environment without the intervention usually required by an internal IT organization.In effect, the RESTful API extends the reach and scope of the self-service capabilities of the Adaptive Data Preparation platform, says Bardoiwalla.Via the REST API, for example, organizations can use the Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler to automate everything from the ingestion of data to the actual preparation of the data itself, says Bardoiwalla.Designed to eliminate much of the low level coding associated with setting up a Big Data analytics application, Bardoiwalla says the Adaptive Data Preparation platform is specifically designed to be deployed on premise or in the cloud.</p>
