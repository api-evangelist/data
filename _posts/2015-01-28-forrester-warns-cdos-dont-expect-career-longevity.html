<p>Via Forrester                                          
Predicting the corporate demand for chief digital officers is turning out to be a tough task.On one hand, a report released today from research firm Forrester suggests that most firms that have not already hired a CDO are not planning to do so over the next year.That is in contrast to a report released last October from fellow research from IDC, which predicted that, within five years, roughly 60 percent of CIOs would be supplanted by CDOs.Whats Hot on ZDNet

 Such a bold claim from IDC drew some skepticism, especially from ZDNet editor-in-chief Larry Dignan:
The CDO is a transition role.Every company on the planet will be digital and that means most execs will lean that way.</p>
