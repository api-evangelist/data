<p>The above GIF is from an episode of The Wire from Season 2.The docks are ubiquitous in season 2, and this particular image is a visualization of a cloned machine that captures the vanishing container—presumably filled with illegal cargo.I’m fascinated by the representation of technology throughout the series, but season 2 in particular is really interesting.There’s the digital technology of camera, the web, GPS, and much more that’s constantly being discussed, but there’s also the radical changes to the physical technology of the dock.The first part of the following video features the presentation from Season 2, Episode 7 about the automation of the port of Rotterdam.</p>
