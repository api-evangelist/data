<p>Despite the tech sector’s tendency to relish breakthrough innovations, most big problems can’t be solved by an inventive algorithm or helpful new feature.More often than not, the companies that solve these slow problems rely on a combination of small inventions, good timing, and changing economics.Count local information as one of those slow problems.The industry is still trying to marry the high cost of collecting quality local information with a market that’s flooded with the kind of cheap data that’s often just good enough.Startups like Yext have raised millions to rethink the problem, while massive companies — namely, Apple — have discovered the challenge the hard way.</p>
