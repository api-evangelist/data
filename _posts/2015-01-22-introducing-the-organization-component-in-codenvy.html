<p>Codenvy provisions, shares and scales developer workspaces, and was designed to allow DevOps and developers to work collaboratively.Codenvy eliminates configuration and reuses cloud resources to perform builds and debugging sessions at scale.This week we introduced Codenvy version 3.5 which includes the Organization component that administers permissions and resources across team members.The Organization component is part of our SaaS Team and Enterprise packages, and is active by default with Codenvy On-Prem.</p>
