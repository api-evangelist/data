<p>Over the past several years, the Sunlight Foundation has spent a lot of time talking about the need for governments to create comprehensive lists of their information holdings — and to release those lists to the public.You can expect more of the same in 2015.In our Open Data Guidelines, we argue that “for an open data policy to have a strong foundation, you first need to know what data you have — and so does the public.”
The federal government embraced the first part of this in 2013 when President Obama released his open data executive order.Project Open Data, the effort to implement the executive order, requires agencies to create and maintain “enterprise data inventories,” comprehensive lists of an agency’s information holdings.</p>
