<p>BigML is very excited to be collaborating with Tableau Software as a newly minted Tableau Technology Partner.  This is a natural fit as both companies share similar philosophies on making analytics accessible (and enjoyable) to more people through incorporation of intuitive and easy-to-use tools.Not surprisingly, there’s a lot of overlap between our users: our latest survey showed that over 50% of BigML’s users also use Tableau.And of course, we’re eager to introduce Tableau’s customers to the predictive power of BigML.So what does this mean for BigML and Tableau users?</p>
