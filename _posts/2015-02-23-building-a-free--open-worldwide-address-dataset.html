<p>Finding your way through the world is a basic need, so it makes sense that satellite navigation systems like GPS and Galileo are among open data’s most-cited success stories.But as wonderful as those systems are, they’re often more useful to robots than people.Humans usually navigate by addresses, not coordinates.That means that address data is an essential part of any complete mapping system.Unfortunately, address data has historically been difficult to obtain.</p>
