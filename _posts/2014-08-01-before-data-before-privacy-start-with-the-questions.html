<p>There has been a great deal of discussion lately about the need to secure student data and protect student privacy.I won’t rehash the recent history and seemingly countless articles and blog posts on the subject and instead will simply state that we at LearnSprout support the proposed Markey-Hatch legislation and stand firm with our position that students’ personally identifiable information (PII) should not be available to anyone beyond the local education agency (LEA) level, whether it be a small charter school or very large public school district.We’ve worked hard to make our Privacy Policy the strongest in education and consider ourselves advocates for student privacy.Now… With that out of the way, I want to ask a very simple question, and I recognize that it’s the type of question that could label me as a heretic within our new, highly aspirational Edtech space but in my humble opinion, it’s where we all conversations about student privacy need to start.Why do we need all this data anyway?</p>
