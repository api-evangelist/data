<p>As the United States government prepares to implement the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), perhaps it can learn from other countries that already use open data standards for government reporting.That was the hope as representatives from several foreign governments described their open-data projects at a panel held in Washington, D.C., last week by the Data Transparency Coalition, a group lobbying for open data.The DATA Act, which President Obama signed into law in May, is intended to standardize government spending data and make it more transparent, thereby increasing government accountability.</p>
