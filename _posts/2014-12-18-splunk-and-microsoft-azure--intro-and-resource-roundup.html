<p>We are often asked by customers about how Splunk can integrate with, or run in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.There’s actually a fair bit of information about this broad topic on splunk.com and elsewhere, but it can be a bit hard to find.This post will serve as an introduction to a few Azure terms, and a round-up of available resources. Subsequent posts will cover some of these concepts in more detail–just look for the posts tagged “Azure”!</p>
