<p>It’s safe to say that Docker has had a momentous year with the container-management startup gaining a lot of developer interest and scoring a lot of support from big tech companies like Amazon, Google, VMware and Microsoft.Docker CEO Ben Golub came on to the Structure Show this week to talk about Docker’s year and what he envisions the company to be as it continues to grow (hint: it’s aiming for something similar to VMware).Golub also talks about Docker’s raft of new orchestration features and shares his thoughts on the new CoreOS container technology and how that fits in with Docker.If you listened to our recent Structure Show featuring CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi and are curious to hear Docker’s reaction and perspective on Rocket, you’ll definitely want to hear this week’s episode.In other news, Derrick Harris and Barb Darrow kick things off by looking at how Hortonworks and New Relic shares were holding up and the good news is — they’re doing pretty well at the ripe old age of 1 week.</p>
