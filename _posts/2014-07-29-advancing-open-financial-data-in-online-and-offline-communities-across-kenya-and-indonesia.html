<p>Understanding the demand for open data seems like more of an art than a science.In many cases, given the free nature of open data, we are often limited to analyzing unique visitors, downloads, and consumption patterns at data engagement events.To publishers of open data seeking to respond to stakeholder demand, this incomplete measurement of data use and consumption can feel limiting and frustrating.Open data in large part is possible due to the dramatic power and potential that the Internet and other technologies continue to bring us.As the latest information revolution continues to unfold, estimates suggest that about three-fifths of the world is offline in 2014.</p>
