<p>TL;DR Prevent arbitrary inter-container communication by setting icc=false and using container linking.If you enjoy or learn something from this article, consider buying my book, Docker in Action.It will be the Manning deal of the day (48 hours) on January 6th using promo code: dotd010615au.Last week I wrote, Exploring Local Docker Bridge Networks.In that article I described how to use nmap to explore the services exposed by other containers on the same bridge network.</p>
