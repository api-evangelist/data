<p>Last week, SteveMaier_, a physics professor at Northwestern Oklahoma State University, put together this contour map visualizing the increased seismic activity in Oklahoma.It shows that not only were there 8 times more earthquakes in Oklahoma from 2004-2013 than there were in the 90s, but many of these recent earthquakes were larger and shallower than any in the 90s.What exactly is going on is a little controversial, but according to a joint statement issued by USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey on May 2, oil and gas production techniques like fracking might be to blame:  
USGS statistically analyzed the recent earthquake rate changes and found that they do not seem to be due to typical, random fluctuations in natural seismicity rates.The analysis suggests that a likely contributing factor to the increase in earthquakes is triggering by wastewater injected into deep geologic formations.This brings us to another awesome plotly application: a DIY seismograph.</p>
