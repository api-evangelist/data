<p>When something is hyped as much as the notion of big data, there’s bound to be disappointment when results don’t meet expectations right this second.That realization — that implementation of big data analytics and related technologies hasn’t matched expectations — is a common thread across a recent spate research reports. While corporate execs now “get” the possible impact of aggregating and analyzing all the data their companies generate, very few companies have realized that potential.Most adoption remains at pilot or test stage
A new McKinsey Quarterly report acknowledged that earlier predictions that retailers would parlay big data analytics to boost operating margins by more than 60 percent, and that the healthcare sector could likewise use the technology to slice costs 8 percent, haven’t played out.While massively scaled companies like Amazon and Google use data analytics to wring out significant costs, data analytics success at most legacy companies is limited to a few test projects or narrow pieces of the overall business.</p>
