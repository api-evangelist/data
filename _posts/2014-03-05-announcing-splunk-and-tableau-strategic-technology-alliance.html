<p>We’re very excited to announce the alliance between Splunk and Tableau Software that extends machine data insights to Tableau users.As part of a joint technology investment, the latest version of Tableau software (8.1.4) includes Splunk Enterprise as a native data source using Splunk’s recently launched ODBC driver.The integration provides Tableau users direct access to saved searches within Splunk Enterprise 6 from Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server, using Splunk’s new ODBC driver, for further data exploration and visualization.</p>
