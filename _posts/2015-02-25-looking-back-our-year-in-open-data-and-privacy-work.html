<p>At the end of this month, the Open Data & Privacy project (funded by OSF) formally closes.Over the past year (during which we implemented the project), Javier Ruiz and I (as the core team) have attempted to gingerly navigate this complex environment of trying to understand if and how  open (data) and privacy can find a balance.I would like to believe that we have done this with some amount of success.Of course there has always been the support of a really knowledgeable expert community to tap into. And I would like to duly acknowledge the input of in particular, Malavika Jayaram, Mark Lizar, Reuben Binns, Antti Poikola and Walter van Holst.</p>
