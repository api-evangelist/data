<p>Nathan Schor pointed me at an article about Metromile that appeared in TechCrunch recently.Metromile is a per-mile insurance company that uses a OBD II device that you plug in your car.It tracks your vehicle stats, similar to Fuse, Automatic, and other connected car services.The kicker is that its free because Metromile is making money by selling per-mile insurance.The more users they have using their device the bigger their potential market for selling insurance.</p>
