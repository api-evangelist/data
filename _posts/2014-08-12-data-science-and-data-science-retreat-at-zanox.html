<p>Data science plays an important role in today’s online landscape, especially in a performance-driven environment.At zanox we have a dedicated team to evaluate our data and generate findings.As we believe in the power of data, we are happy to support Data Science Retreat and host their current batch at our Berlin office.From August to October the 10 participants will be trained and mentored by data science professionals like our Chief Data Scientist Adam Drake.A unique feature of DSR is that all mentors have experience as chief data scientists as Jose Quesada, DSR’s director, wanted mentors to be the sort of people who make decisions about which problems to go after.</p>
