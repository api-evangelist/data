<p>It’s only been seven months since Twitter released its Answers tool, which was designed to provide users with mobile application analytics.But since that time, Twitter now sees roughly five billion daily sessions in which “hundreds of millions of devices send millions of events every second to the Answers endpoint,” the company explained in a blog post on Tuesday.Clearly, that’s a lot of data that needs to get processed and in the blog post, Twitter detailed how it configured its architecture to handle the task.The backbone of Answers was created to handle how the mobile application data is received, archived, processed in real time and processed in chunks (otherwise known as batch processing).Each time an organization uses the Answer tool to learn more how his or her mobile app is functioning, Twitter logs and compresses all that data (which gets set in batches) in order to conserve the device’s battery power while also not putting too much unnecessary strain on the network that routes the data from the device to Twitter’s servers.</p>
