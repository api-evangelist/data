<p>Last week, we kicked off our series to introduce container technologies, which are changing the way that people deploy and manage applications.DockerÂ has emerged as a popular technology for application containerization, revolutionizing how applications are built, deployed and managed.Google Cloud Platform offers rich support for Docker containers through the fully managed Google Container Engine service powered by Kubernetes, container optimized VMs on Google Compute Engine, and Managed VMs for Google App Engine.Today we are announcing the beta release of a new service:  Google Container Registry for the secure hosting, sharing, and management of private container repositories.zulily, an online retailer that offers thousands of new and unique products each day, was an early adopter of the registry service.</p>
