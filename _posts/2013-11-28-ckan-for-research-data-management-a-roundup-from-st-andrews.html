<p>A new blog post from Birgit Plietzsch at St Andrews University provides an interesting survey of projects using CKAN for research data management projects.St Andrews themselves have a pilot project in this area, and Dr Plietzsch had solicited input from other projects on the ‘ckan4rdm’ mailing list.The post summarises the responses she received.It’s noticeable that there are now quite a few RDM projects using CKAN in production environments or in pilots, most of them newcomers since the CKAN4RDM workshop earlier this year.Another project in the area that didn’t make it into the St Andrews round-up is EDaWaX, subject of a recent post on this blog.</p>
