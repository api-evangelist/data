<p>As a technology optimist, I don’t tend to go in so much for writing up long critical pieces about tech (i.e.I don’t do the “proper” academic thing), instead preferring to spend time trying to work out how make use of it, either on its own or in tandem with other technologies.(My criticality is often limited to quickly ruling out things I don’t want to waste my time on because they lack interestingness, or in spending time how to appropriate one thing to do something it perhaps wasn’t intended to do originally.)
I also fall in to the camp of lacking in confidence about things other people think I know about, generally assuming there are probably “proper” ways of doing things for someone properly knowledgeable in a tradition, although I don’t know what they are.</p>
