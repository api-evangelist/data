<p>Weave creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers deployed across multiple hosts.Applications use the network just as if the containers were all plugged into the same network switch, with no need to configure port mappings, links, etc.Services provided by application containers on the weave network can be made accessible to the outside world, regardless of where those containers are running.Similarly, existing internal systems can be exposed to application containers irrespective of their location.Weave can traverse firewalls and operate in partially connected networks.</p>
