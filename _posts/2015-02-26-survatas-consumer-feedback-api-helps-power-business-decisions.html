<p>The success of a company is so often related to how well they understand their customers.With today’s growing fascination with big data, users’ opinions are sometimes ignored.Since 2012, San Francisco-based Survata has been embracing the power of consumer feedback by offering businesses customized surveys distributed across their network of affiliate sites.Last week, the company announced the launch of their latest API, which allows developers to access the survey data from within their own application, among other things.Catering to everything from large enterprises to small businesses, Survata uses information as currency by offering consumers access to free content such as articles, music, videos, and downloads, provided the user completes a short survey.</p>
