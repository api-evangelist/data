<p>[Summary: blogging the three-page version of Open Data in Developing Countries - Emerging Insights from Phase I paper, with some preamble]  
I’m back living in Oxford after my almost-year in the USA at the Berkman Center.Before we returned, Rachel and I took a month to travel around the US – by Amtrak.The delightfully ponderous pace of US trains gave me plenty of time for reading, which was just as well, given June was the month when most of the partners in the Open Data in Developing Countries project I coordinate were producing their final reports.So, in-between time staring at the stunning scenery as we climbed through the Rockies, or watching amazing lightening storms from the viewing car, I was digging through in-depth reports into open data in the global south, and trying to pick out common themes and issues.A combination of post-it notes and scrivener index cards later, and finally back at my desk in Oxford, the result was a report, released alongside the ODDC Research Sharing Event in Berlin last week, that seeks to snapshot 15 insights or provocations for policy-makers and practitioners drawn out from the ODDC case study reports.</p>
