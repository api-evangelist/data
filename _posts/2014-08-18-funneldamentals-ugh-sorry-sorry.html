<p>Beyond Funneldamentals: A More Powerful Behavior Analysis API                                 
A couple weeks back you maybe saw that we released a slew of new features for Keen IO, including some new capabilities for our funnels API.Which, if you know what funnels are and how they work, you were probably like, “Hey, yay, great, fun!” But, if you’re anything like me (I hadn’t really used funnels before I started working on them here), you might have been more like, “Um, yay, great, fun?Now we can fill all those… data bottles more easily?”  
So, for both you newbies and you sophisticated old hats, consider this a crash course in funnels – and in what Keen IO can now do to help you out with them.</p>
