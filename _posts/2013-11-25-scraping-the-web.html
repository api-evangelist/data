<p>School of Data is re-publishing Noah Veltman‘s Learning Lunches, a series of tutorials that demystify technical subjects relevant to the data journalism newsroom.This Learning Lunch is about web scraping: automatically extracting data from web pages.Web scraping refers to the practice of writing code that will load a web page in order to extract some information from it automatically.It’s like a Roomba for the web.Let’s say you wanted to save information about every US federal law with a certain keyword in it.</p>
