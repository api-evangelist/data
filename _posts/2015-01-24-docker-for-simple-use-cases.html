<p>As you probably know, I work as an API Evangelist at Akamai, and we’ve been working to decrease the learning curve for getting started with our APIs. We’ve got an excellent online tutorial and our evangelists travel around giving workshops to our customers so they can get some hands-on experience using the system.Unfortunately, the system setup during workshops has revealed to me that the system setup for the exercises can frequently take longer than the actual exercises. Different operating systems, custom setup or configuration and specific development environments can make a relatively straightforward process challenging.I found a similar challenge when working on my “Irresistible APIs” book.</p>
