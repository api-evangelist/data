<p>In previous posts in this series, we’ve looked at how modern applications are built, the rise of micro services architecture, and what this new application architecture means for services governance.We’ve also argued that integration patterns are not required in the DevOps world.This time we examine the important difference between the way data is leveraged in the API-centric architecture and one based on integration technologies.One of the first casualties of the transition to an API-centric architecture is the practice of ETL (extract, transform, load). 
In a pre-API architecture, many organizations find it necessary to have teams dedicated to extracting data by reverse engineering an app’s internal structures and accessing databases directly, bypassing application logic.</p>
