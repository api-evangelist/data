<p>Sometimes in the world of social data it is hard to grasp the amazing possibilities when we use words to describe things.The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words is true, so we wanted to show you what our new Profile Geo enrichment does.First, here is what Profile Geo is:
 Gnip’s Profile Geo enrichment significantly increases the amount of usable geodata for Twitter.It normalizes unstructured location data from Twitter users’ bio locations and matches those latitude/longitude coordinates for those normalized places.For examples, everyone who mentions “NYC,” New York City,” “Manhattan,” and even some odd instances like “NYC Baby✌” all get normalized to “New York City, New York, United States” so they’re easy to map.</p>
