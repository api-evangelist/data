<p>Facebook announced in a blog post on Thursday that it has upgraded the Apache HBase database with a new open source system called HydraBase. Facebook is an avid HBase shop, using it to store data for various services, including the company’s internal monitoring system, search indexing, streaming data analysis and data scraping.What makes HydraBase better than HBase is that it is supposedly a more reliable database that should minimize downtime when servers fail.With HBase, data is sharded across many regions, with multiple regions hosted on a set of “region servers.” If a region server goes down, all the regions it hosts have to migrate to another region server.</p>
