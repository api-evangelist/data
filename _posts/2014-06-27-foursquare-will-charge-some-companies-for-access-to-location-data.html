<p>Foursquare plans to start charging companies making the heaviest use of its vast local-business database.The massive resource has gradually been enhanced through the years as Foursquare has grown and compiled over 6 billion user check-ins.Thanks to all that activity, the companys location database is seen by many as superior to similar services from Facebook and others.(Many users were displeased when Instagram moved away from Foursquare in favor of Facebooks solution.) Foursquare obviously risks angering developers and pushing them to research other options by charging for access, but COOÂ Jeffrey Glueck told The Wall Street Journal  that the fees will impact less than 1 percent of companies currently pulling from its database.</p>
