<p>Ben Golub isn’t surprised that his startup Docker’s take on container technology has caused this much of a buzz throughout the tech industry; it just happened a whole lot sooner than he thought.“Before the printing press nobody wrote because it was a pain to produce content,” said Golub, CEO of the four-year-old company.“I think Docker in a smaller way is enabling developers to be able to put all their energy into creating amazing applications, rather than worrying about the minutiae of how they are going to run and how they are going to scale and it is a beautiful thing.” 
Docker’s rise from a middling Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) company once known as DotCloud to its current status as a much-heralded container management system that is used by Google, Spotify, Red Hat and others is one that highlights how having the right kind of technology and a large open source community can jump start a company into the spotlight even in a crowded enterprise space.Containers, which are similar to virtual machines, allow developers to isolate their applications from other applications that operate on the same host server.</p>
