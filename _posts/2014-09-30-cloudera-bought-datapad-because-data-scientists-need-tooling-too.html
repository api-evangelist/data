<p>Cloudera has acquired a data-visualization startup called DataPad in order to bring DataPad’s employees, rather than its technology, into its fold.News of the acquisition first hit on Monday when DataPad users, myself included, received an email noting an acquisition and the service’s impending shutdown.On Tuesday, VentureBeat reported a rumor that Cloudera was the mystery buyer, which Gigaom has since confirmed.However, more important than the acquisition of fledgling startup (DataPad launched publicly in May with $1.7 million in seed funding) is what this seems to say about Cloudera’s plans for putting its Hadoop technologies into the hands of more users.</p>
