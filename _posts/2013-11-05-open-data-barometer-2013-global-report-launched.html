<p>Last Thursday the study I’ve spent the last five month working on with the Web Foundation was formally launched in the Open Government Data Working Group session of the Open Government Partnership Summit.The Open Data Barometer takes a look at the context, implementation and emerging impacts of open government data in 77 countries around the world.Last week’s launch included both an analytical report and quantitative datasets for the secondary indicator and expert survey data collected in the study.I’ll be writing more in the coming weeks here about the process of designing and carrying out the study, and reflecting on how it might evolve and be built upon in future.But for now, here’s a link to where you can download the report and data, findings from the exec summary, and a few charts pulled out from the overall report.</p>
