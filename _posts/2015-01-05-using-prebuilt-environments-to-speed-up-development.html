<p>This is the third of several posts over the coming weeks that will help you get the most out of Codenvy.Topics include:
Codenvy provides pre-built environments so you can start coding without needing to spend time on environment configuration.For example, you could start coding in AngularJS right now, we’ve built scaffolding and tools like Grunt or Gulp right in.Or try your first Android project – the SDK and emulator are part of your image out-of-the-box.If you’d like to read ahead, visit our documentation site that includes detailed explanations and examples for using pre-built environments.</p>
