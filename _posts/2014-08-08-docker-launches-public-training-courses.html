<p>Together with the Docker 1.0 release at DockerCon we also announced the launch of commercial services to support Docker.One of these services is education and we’re thrilled to announce the first dates for public Docker training.We’re running training in San Francisco and New York initially.The course is called Introduction to Docker and is a two-day classroom-based training course.</p>
