<p>Today, I am excited to share with you that DataSift has closed a $42M Series C round of funding led by Insight Venture Partners with participation from existing investors Scale Venture Partners, Upfront Ventures, IA Ventures, Northgate Capital, Daher Capital and Cendana Capital.In The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams jokingly posited that “42” was the meaning of the universe. For us, it culminates a period of amazing growth and sets us up for our next phase. As I reflect on the past few years and what the future holds, I realize that the holiday season seems to have a special significance for DataSift.At roughly this time last year, we announced our Series B funding, and two years ago I was alone in our U.</p>
