<p>Data and Goliaths Big Idea
Data and Goliath is a book about surveillance, both government and corporate.Its an exploration in three parts: whats happening, why it matters, and what to do about it.This is a big and important issue, and one that Ive been working on for decades now.Weve been on a headlong path of more and more surveillance, fueled by fear­--of terrorism mostly­--on the government side, and convenience on the corporate side.My goal was to step back and say wait a minute; does any of this make sense?</p>
