<p>Spending Stories, which officially launched Thursday, is a new way to put spending figures in their proper perspective.Developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation and Journalism++ with funding from the Knight Foundation, Spending Stories is an app that helps citizens and journalists understand and compare monetary amounts in stories from the news.When we hear that the UK’s school meals program costs £6 million, what does that really mean?It means, for one thing, that it costs about a fifth of the annual spending on the monarchy.Spending Stories draws out comparisons between amounts of money, giving users a context in which to understand how money is being spent across society while referencing the original news stories.</p>
