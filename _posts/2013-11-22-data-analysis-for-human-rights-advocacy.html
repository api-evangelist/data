<p>At Human Rights Watch, we consistently seek ways to improve our research methods to not only better expose violations of human rights but to be more effective in our advocacy efforts so that we might create meaningful impact.One of the tools in our research methodology toolbox that has been extremely useful in this regard, though it is not without its potential pitfalls, is data analysis.Data analyses can be effective primarily because they allow us to re-frame and examine topics in ways that provide context or insight that is different from the qualitative information gathered through our traditional fact-finding methods.Typically, data allows us to provide an aggregated view of the scope of potential violations.Â  Policymakers, media and the public are often focused on numbers.</p>
