<p>This is the third year in a row that Ive chosen data as one of the top trends in ed-tech.(See 2011, 2012) If youre looking for a sunnier view of data in education, read those.2013, in my opinion, was pretty grim.TIME Magazine announced its Person of the Year this morning: Pope Francis.He seems like a pretty swell guy, don’t get me wrong.</p>
