<p>Last week, Miles Ward, Google Cloud Platform’s Global Head of Solutions, kicked off our Container series with a post about the overarching concepts around containers, Docker, and Kubernetes.If you have not yet had a chance to read his post, we suggest you start there to arm yourself with the knowledge you will need for this post!This week, Joe Beda, Senior Staff Engineer and one of the founding members of the Kubernetes project, will go a level deeper and talk in depth about the core technical concepts that underpin Google’s use of containers.These have informed the creation of Kubernetes and provide a foundation of future posts in this series.The recent rise of container systems like Docker has (rightly) created a lot of excitement.</p>
