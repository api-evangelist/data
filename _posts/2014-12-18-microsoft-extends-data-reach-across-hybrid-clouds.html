<p>Microsoft has moved to make database services running on the Microsoft Azure cloud more accessible by enhancing the level of support it provides Java and PHP developers, while also making available a data management gateway based on an implementation of OData that they created using RESTful APIs.In addition to providing support for Node.js, Python,.NET and JavaScript for the Azure DocumentDB, Microsoft is rolling out a new Java SDK.The company has also updated its Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP and Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server to make it easier to write applications that span SQL Server databases running on premises and the Azure SQL Database running in the cloud.</p>
