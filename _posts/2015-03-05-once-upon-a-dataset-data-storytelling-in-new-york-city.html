<p>In an invigorating, entertaining, and well-attended TEDxNewYork talk about open government data in New York City, data scientist Ben Wellington examines open government data from a citizen’s perspective and urges governments to rethink how they provide access to data.Wellington tells the story of New York City through its open data on his blog I Quant NYC.He’s also a blogger for The New Yorker, and a professor who teaches a statistics course to urban planners and uses real City data sets to “make stats a lot more fun.”
Wellington praises the City of New York for releasing 1,200 datasets on its Socrata-powered portal, NYC Open Data.And re-emphasizes the importance of accessible datasets that can be downloaded and analyzed rather than constrained to static PDFs or –in one case — burned onto a hard drive carried in by a citizen.</p>
