<p>Gigaom’s Structure Data conference is just three months away — March 18 and 19 in New York — and it’s looking like our fifth one will be the best one yet. The goal of his year’s show is to highlight what’s possible now that “big data” technologies have matured, and to give attendees a view into a world where their data can power artificial intelligence as well as business intelligence.We’re adding new speakers every day, but here are the ones we have confirmed so far.Their jobs are sometimes as diverse as their employers, ranging from BuzzFeed to IBM and from economics to robotics:
We will announce more speakers next month (and I promise they won’t disappoint).If you’re interested in hearing how some of the biggest and most-interesting companies around are building data infrastructure and analyzing data; how some of the world’s leading artificial intelligence researchers see the future unfolding; and how all of this might affect business, public and even foreign policy, do yourself a favor and register now.</p>
