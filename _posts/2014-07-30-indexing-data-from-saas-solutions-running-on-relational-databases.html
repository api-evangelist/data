<p>As we began work on building the Salesforce.com app, I was again face to face with a familiar challenge…a challenge that you would encounter anytime you want to ingest structured data coming from any Saas based application that is running on a back-end relational database.In such a Saas based environment, the data is usually exposed via a REST, Webservices API or similar.As you know, in a typical relational database, all data is stored in multiple tables and records are linked across tables using ID’s.For instance the Incident table in ServiceNow does not have the Username that created that ticket but has a User Identifier (long cryptic string) referencing another record in the “Users” table that includes the Username, First Name, Last Name and other information.</p>
