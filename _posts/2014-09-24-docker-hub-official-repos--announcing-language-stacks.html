<p>With Docker containers fast becoming the standard for building blocks for distributed apps, we’re working with the Docker community to make it easier for users to quickly code and assemble their projects. Official Repos, publicly downloadable for free from the Docker Hub Registry, are curated images informed by user feedback and best practices. They represent a focused community effort to provide great base images for applications, so developers and sysadmins can focus on building new features and functionality while minimizing repetitive work on commodity scaffolding and plumbing.At DockerCon last June, we announced the first batch of Official Repos which covered many standard tools like OS distributions, web servers, and databases. At the time, we had several organizations join us to curate Official Repos for their particular project, including Fedora, CentOS, and Canonical.</p>
