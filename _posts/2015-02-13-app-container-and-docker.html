<p>A core principle of the App Container (appc) specification is that it is open: multiple implementations of the spec should exist and be developed independently.Even though the spec is young and pre-1.0, it has already seen a number of implementations.With this in mind, over the last few weeks we have been working on ways to make appc interoperable with the Docker v1 Image format.As we discovered, the two formats are sufficiently compatible that Docker v1 Images can easily be run alongside appc images (ACIs).</p>
