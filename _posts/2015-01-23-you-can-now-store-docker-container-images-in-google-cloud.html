<p>Google Cloud users can now load up their private Docker container images into the search giant’s new Google Container Registry, which Google said Friday is now available in beta and the company noted “is not covered by any SLA or deprecation policy and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes.”
If you are a Google Cloud customer, your Docker container images — which contain all the necessary components for spinning up containers, like the source code and binary files — will be “automatically encrypted before they are written to disk,” according to the Google blog post detailing the registry.From the blog post:
Access control: The registry service hosts your private images in Google Cloud Storage under your Google Cloud Platform project.This ensures by default that your private images can only be accessed by members of your project, enabling them to securely push and pull images through the Google Cloud SDK command line.Container host VMs can then access secured images without additional effort.</p>
