<p>The Open Knowledge Foundation has joined more than 30 civil society organisations and experts in signing an open letter asking leaders for greater transparency around the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations.The controversial negotiations have been covered in The Guardian and  The Washington Post over the past few days following the leaking of a draft chapter on intellectual property which suggests that the treaty may look to  extend IP protections and to strengthen their enforcement.The full text of the letter is reproduced below.Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia
 Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei
 Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada
 Sebastian Pinera, President of Chile
 Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan
 Najib Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia
 Enrique Pena Nieto, President of Mexico
 John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand
 Ollanta Humala, President of Peru
 Tony Tan, President of Singapore
 Ma Ying-jeou, President of Taiwan
 Barack Obama, President of the United States of America
 Truong Tan Sang, President of Vietnam
 We, the undersigned civil society groups, urge you to conduct any further trade negotiations in a manner consistent with the democratic principles of openness and accountability.Countries participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations must reconcile the radically secretive process against the transparency values they purport to hold, to strengthen the legitimacy of any international agreements, and to seek appropriate balance between corporate and public interests.</p>
