<p>Whilst preparing for what turned out to be a very enjoyable data at the BBC Data Data in Birmingham on Tuesday, where I ran a session on Open Refine [slides] I’d noticed that one of the transformations Open Refine supports is hashing using either MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms.What these functions essentially do is map a value, such as a name or personal identifier, on to what looks like a random number.The mapping is one way, so give the hash value of a name or personal identifier, you can’t go back to the original.(The way the algorithms work means that there is also a very slight possibility that two different original values will map on to the same hashed value which may in turn cause errors when analysing the data.)
We can generate the hash of values in a column by transforming the column using the formula md5(value) or sha1(value).</p>
