<p>The Open Knowledge Foundation is a multi-award winning international not-for-profit organisation.We build tools and communities to create, use and share open knowledge – content and data that everyone can use, share and build on.We believe that by creating an open knowledge commons and developing tools and communities around this we can make a significant contribution to improving governance, research and the economy.We’re changing the world by promoting a global shift towards more open ways of working in government, arts, sciences and much more.We don’t just talk about ideas, we deliver extraordinary software, events and publications.</p>
