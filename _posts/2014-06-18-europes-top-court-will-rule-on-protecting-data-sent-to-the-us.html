<p>In the wake of revelations about NSA snooping, Europes highest court is set to re-evaluate the rules around international data transfers.A European commission decided in 2000 that personal information could be sent across borders, provided countries abided by certain principles.But an Austrian group of privacy advocates claims Edward Snowdens revelations show the NSA wasnt abiding by those rules.Are safe harbor agreements from 2000 still relevant?Last year, Europe-v-Facebook filed a complaint with theÂ Irish Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
