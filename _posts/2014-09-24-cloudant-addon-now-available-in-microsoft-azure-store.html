<p>We’re excited to announce that Cloudant DBaaS is now available as an add-on through the Azure Store, Microsoft’s application platform for the public cloud.Adding Cloudant to the Microsoft Azure Store underscores Cloudant’s commitment to an open cloud ecosystem, and provides Azure users with more options for simplifying data management for their apps.After launching a Cloudant multi-tenant cluster on Microsoft Azure infrastructure in 2012, we’ve been working together behind the scenes to tune performance and create the best possible experience for our customers.Now that Cloudant is available as an add-on in the Azure Store, we hope you’ll find the service easy to provision and a natural fit for storing the variably structured objects common to modern Web and mobile applications.The integration allows developers to provision Cloudant databases directly from their Microsoft Azure management portal for a consolidated view of usage and billing.</p>
