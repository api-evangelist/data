<p>In a Sqrrl press release today, Splunk partner Sqrrl introduced a connector to Hunk, joining the previously published Hunk apps with Amazon Web Services and MongoDB.Using Hunk’s virtual indexing and result preview capabilities, you see search query results as they are streamed back from the Sqrrl Enterprise server, while taking advantage of Apache Accumulo’s cell level security.Apache Accumulo is based on Google’s BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper and Thrift.Gartner recently named Sqrrl a 2014 Cool Vendor.“Integration between Sqrrl Enterprise and Hunk opens the door for our joint customers in the U.</p>
