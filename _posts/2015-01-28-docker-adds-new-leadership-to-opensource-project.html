<p>Docker is rejiggering the operational structure of the Docker open-source container project and is adding a couple of people to help oversee the project alongside with Docker, Inc.co-founder and CTO Solomon Hykes.The new leadership roles are the chief architect, chief maintainer and chief operator, and they were created to help Docker accommodate its rapid growth.Docker claims that it now has roughly 740 project contributors and that the open-source project has generated 85,000 Docker-specific applications and more than 20,000 projects like management frameworks and monitoring tools.Hykes will take on the role of chief architect, in which heâ€™ll be responsible for outlining future endeavors of the Docker project like its recently-released orchestration services.</p>
