<p>Before we jump into the conversation on who actually owns your address book, we need to clarify what exactly your address book IS.It is not simply a compilation of your contacts’ email addresses, but much more.Our “smart” address books also hold phone numbers, birthdays, home addresses, and any notes we enter into a contact’s file.As a goldmine of potential networking opportunities, it is no surprise that debates have risen over the proper privacy and sharing practices involving address books.When we give someone our contact information, we presume it will be used solely for his or her own purposes, unless otherwise specified.</p>
