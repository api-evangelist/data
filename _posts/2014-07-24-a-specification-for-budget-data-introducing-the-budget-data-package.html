<p>As we descend into the buzz of the biggest week of the open calendar at OKFestival, the OpenSpending team wanted to quickly drop you a line about a piece of research we have been collaborating on together with the International Budget Partnership, Omidyar Network, and Google: a draft specification for budget data.As members of this community will be only too aware, the benefits of structured, machine-readable, and internationally comparable budget data have now been discussed in numerous fora.A flexible but usable global data standard would need to be developed and widely adopted to make this happen.Recognising the significant challenges posed by variations across national and sub-national budgets, Open Knowledge, with input and technical advice from the International Budget Partnership, Omidyar Network and Google, have begun a scoping exercise, producing an initial proposal for a draft specification (Budget Data package) which could form the basis of a global standard.Input from the whole financial data community – publishers, investigators, citizens – is going to be necessary if this specification is going to meet users’ needs and become a true standard: an open consultation session begins.</p>
