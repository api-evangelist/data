<p>Most people using Splunk Enterprise today would probably agree that theyâ€™re getting valuable insights from the machine data their applications, technology and devices continuously generate.Splunk helps thousands of organizations use their data to drive higher service uptime, prevent cyber-security attacks and drive completely new and valuable insights for their business.IT teams know the value of machine data and leverage it every day, but what about the other users in your organization.How do you share that data with them, without always being the go-to guy?What about users in your organization that are already using an analytics tool such as Microsoft Excel or Tableau Desktop?</p>
