<p>EC2 Container Service  (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run distributed applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.My colleague Chris Barclay sent a guest post to spread the word about two additions to the service.As Chris explains below, you can use images stored in private Docker repositories.You can also store and share information between containers using data volumes from the host.Let’s see what Chris has to say!</p>
