<p>The arrival of 2015 should bring with it a more disciplined approach to building mobile computing applications in the enterprise by relying more on back-end-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms that, thanks to Docker containers, will soon be more portable between different operating systems.Cathal McGloin, vice president of mobile platforms for Red Hat, says that now that Red Hat has embraced Docker containers, itâ€™s only a matter of time before the FeedHenry BaaS platform that Red Hat acquired in 2014 gets deployed on top of multiple operating systems via a Docker container architecture.That capability, says McGloin, will be critical in terms of imposing more structure on how mobile applications are built across the enterprise.Today most organizations are still building mobile applications one at a time, which results in a considerable increase in mobile application development backlog.By employing a more platform-centric approach that relies on RESTful APIs, organizations will be able to build more mobile applications significantly faster, says McGloin.</p>
