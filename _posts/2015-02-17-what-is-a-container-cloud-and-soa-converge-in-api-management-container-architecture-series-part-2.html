<p>This is the second in a series of posts on container-centric integration architecture.The first post   provided a brief background and definition of the Container architecture pattern.This post explores how Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Cloud initiatives converge in API Management, and how Platforms provide the Containerization infrastructure necessary for API Management.Today we are seeing an increasing emphasis on Services and Composite Applications as the unit of product management in the Cloud. Indeed, API Management can be seen as the logical convergence of Cloud and SOA paradigms.</p>
