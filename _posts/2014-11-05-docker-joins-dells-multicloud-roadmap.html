<p>Today, Dell took another stride forward with its multi-cloud roadmap by launching the Dell Cloud Marketplace beta program, which includes key industry alliances with Docker, Delphix and Pertino.The Dell Cloud Marketplace provides developers and IT managers with the ability to compare, purchase, use and manage public cloud services from a range of vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Joyent.This can be achieved through a single, unified console on Dell.com.We at Docker are in full support of Dell’s commitment to accelerating the adoption of multi-cloud environments, particularly given the imperative of the Docker open platform toward ensuring portability across any infrastructure.</p>
