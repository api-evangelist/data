<p>A key element of the big data business is getting what much of computer technology secretly craves: Normality.On Tuesday, several companies involved in analyzing digital information announced a common set of standards for Hadoop, perhaps the most widespread framework for technology analysis.The companies, including General Electric, Hortonworks, IBM, Pivotal and Verizon, said they would develop their products and services on a common core of Hadoopâ€™s key components.Common standards often follow early development of software and hardware.If more companies use the same stuff, it usually helps with things like learning and certification, application development, and new products.</p>
