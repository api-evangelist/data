<p>At Vator Splash Health on Thursday, Practice Fusion CEO Ryan Howard talked a lot about the amount of data his company has, even going so far as to say that the company has collected so much that it can actually predict a patients quality of life.But the big question is: who owns that data, what happens to it and who can Practice Fusion share/sell it to?When Vator founder and CEO Bambi Francisco asked Howard about whether or not there would eventually be interoperability between the company and other EHRs, meaning whether they would share the data with each other, Ryan responded that, yes, that is what he thinks will eventually come to pass.Lets say you are Allscripts and you have 50 thousand prescriptions, theres no way to go to 50 thousand doctors offices and extract that data, he said, while also noting that it is the doctor who owns that data anyway.That is why a cloud-based model, where data can be easily shared, is so important.</p>
