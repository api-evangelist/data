<p>I have argued elsewhere that researchers should embrace scholarly openness because of the disciplinary benefits it affords.Specifically, and as is widely argued, Open Data ensures that research can be verified through replication and reused to pose and help answer new questions.Furthermore, in the humanities, Open Data can also contribute to the cultural commons, especially through initiatives such as the DPLA and Europeana.Open Data thus helps research move to more of an economy of sharing, rather than one of mere competition.But the truth is that academia can be a ruthless area to work in and holding onto data is one way that researchers in some disciplines try to maintain a competitive advantage over their peers.</p>
