<p>I recently joined Splunk working on our developer platform efforts driving our SDKs and Tools.We are excited to be taking forward our dev platform and continuing to bring you better and better support for integrating with Splunk, extending Splunk, and building Splunk applications.On the dev plaform team we are now planning out what we’re going to do in the future.We’d love to have you help us figure out where we go next:
 Should we invest in SDKs for mobile devices like IOS and Android?Are there specific Splunk features like Data Models you’d like to see surface in our existing SDKS?</p>
