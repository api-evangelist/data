<p>Docker and containers are transforming how we architect, package and deploy modern applications.So why then are so many of us still running Dockerized apps on the same cloud infrastructure weve had for ten years?Why are we running our apps on clipper ships and stuffing containers onto break bulk haulers?Why are we running Docker on VMs?At Joyent, we think theres a better way.</p>
