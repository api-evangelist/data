<p>Our SQL Layer is currently in public Beta.One of the questions we most frequently get asked is: How does it store data in the Key-Value store, and could I access it directly as keys and values?To demystify this without sending you off to read the open source code, lets explore some simple examples.Keep in mind that direct access to keys and values is rarely necessary, as the performance overhead of the SQL Layer is negligible, and data access is much more convenient via the REST API, an ORM, or the SQL-Layer command line interface.The SQL-layer operates on top of the Key-Value store (see architecture), and uses the standard FoundationDB Key-Value API to interact with the Key-Value store.</p>
