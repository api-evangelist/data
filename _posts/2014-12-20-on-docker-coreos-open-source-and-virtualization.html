<p>In early December, container-specialist Docker was gearing up for its Amsterdam conference and the debut of its new orchestration services and Docker Enterprise product line.But before Docker co-founder and CTO Solomon Hykes got a chance to board the plane, he got word that operating-system provider CoreOS announced its own Rocket container technology, which caught the Docker team off guard, according to Docker CEO Ben Golub in this week’s Structure Show.“I’ll be the first to say, I think we probably struggled to understand it,” said Golub.Subscribe in iTunes
Let’s clear some misunderstandings
Golub addressed what CoreOS co-founder CEO Alex Polvi told Gigaom on another recent Structure Show and said that there have been “concerns raised about Docker, some of which we think are legitimate, some of which we think are misunderstandings,” especially when it comes to the notion that Docker is “bloated” (Polvi’s word choice) and is offering a container technology that comes packaged with features users may not want.“I don’t believe that if people take a look at what we have that we are forcing people to use our orchestration or that we are being monolithic in terms of the lower-level container format that we support.</p>
