<p>When setting up alerts that send emails, I find it nice to be able to send the sample alerts to a local SMTP server.Itâ€™s useful for testing my thresholds and to rule out spam or mail routing rules.Luckily for us, the Python shipped with Splunk also comes with smtpd.py, which is very easy to setup..</p>
