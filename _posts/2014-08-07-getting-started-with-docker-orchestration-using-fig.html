<p>Last month we announced Docker, Inc.’s acquisition of Orchard, builders of a Docker hosting service as well as an orchestration tool, Fig. If you’ve started using Docker and have been wondering how to define and control a multi-container service – for example, a web app in one container and a database in another – then we think you’ll find Fig really helpful.For this first example, we’ll show how to get a Python web app working with Redis, each in a separate container. We’ll show how Fig lets you define the link between the two containers and indicate that the web app container is dependent on the Redis container.</p>
