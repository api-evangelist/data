<p>FalconStorÂ 
FalconStor Software announced Wednesday its latest software-defined  storage and data protection offering for unified data services which enables  cloud, and modernizes enterprise infrastructures.The unified platform offers migration,  continuity, protection, recovery and optimization for any storage environment  through a single management interface for a single price based on managed  capacity across arrays, servers, hypervisors, data centers and the cloud.The horizontal, software- defined storage platform FreeStor modernizes  the enterprise.While virtualization has streamlined some common tasks associated  with managing data resources, the introduction of a virtualization layer brings  a whole new level of complexity to the protection, recovery and integration of  both virtual and non-virtualized resources.FreeStor is ideal for organizations using legacy technology  and wanting to move to newer technologies, such as flash, or looking to  leverage private or hybrid clouds; MSPs looking to move data into their cloud  and provide common data management services; or OEMs wanting to provide a full,  robust set of data management services.</p>
