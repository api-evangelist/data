<p>The lingua franca for web data is a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).It’s easier for people and machines to read and write than its predecessor, XML.And because JSON is JavaScript it’s a natural choice for a web increasingly powered by JavaScript code.Like XML before it, though, JSON is only easy for some people to read and write: programmers.Most people need their interaction with JSON data to be mediated by HTML forms.</p>
