<p>Today, at DockerCon, we will have a demonstration showing the deployment of Docker directly into an Azure Linux Virtual Machine using the Azure extension technology.It is similar to what we demonstrated with Chef and Linux integration at ChefConf, explained in my Freakin’ Delightful post.The Azure Docker support goes one step further and integrates with our cross-platform CLI toolset, built by the Microsoft Open Technologies team, allowing a simple “azure vm docker create” command to launch the magic of Docker on Linux on Azure.Coolness.We built extensions in Azure to make it easy to use the solutions you love.</p>
