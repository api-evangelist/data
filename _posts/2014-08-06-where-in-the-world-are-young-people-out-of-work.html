<p>As International Youth Day approaches next week, Ive found myself wondering what are the primary issues affecting young people throughout the world.One topic that seems to be a common thread across regions and income groups is youth unemployment, which remains more than double the rate of unemployment for the general population.Its well known that youth populations are on the rise in the developing world, particularly.What does this mean for the millions of young people who enter the workforce every year?Youth unemployment is defined as individuals aged 15-24 who are without work, but are currently available for work and have sought it in the recent past.</p>
