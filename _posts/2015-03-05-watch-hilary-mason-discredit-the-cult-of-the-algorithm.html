<p>Want to see Hilary Mason, the CEO and founder at Fast Forward Labs, get fired up?Tell her about your new connected product and its machine learning algorithm that will help it anticipate your needs over time and behave accordingly.“That’s just a bunch of marketing bullshit,” said Mason when I asked her about these claims.Mason actually builds algorithms and is well-versed in what they can and cannot do.She’s quick to dismantle the cult that has been built up around algorithms and machine learning as companies try to make sense of all the data they have coming in, and as they try to market products built on learning algorithms in the wake of Nest’s $3.</p>
