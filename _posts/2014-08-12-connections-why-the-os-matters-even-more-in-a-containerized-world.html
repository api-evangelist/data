<p>My former colleague (and frequent host for good beer at events) Stephen O’Grady of RedMonk has written a typically smart piece titled “What is the Atomic Unit of Computing?” which makes some important points.However, on one particular point I’d like to share a somewhat different perspective in the context of my cloud work at Red Hat.He makes that point when he writes: Perhaps more importantly, however, there are two larger industry shifts at work which ease the adoption of container technologies… More specific to containers specifically, however, is the steady erosion in the importance of the operating system.It’s not the operating system that’s becoming less important even as it continues to evolve.</p>
