<p>Today we are very happy to announce DockerCon 2015, the second edition of the official Docker conference organized by Docker, Inc in the United States.The conference will take place in San Francisco, at the the San Francisco Marriott Marquis on June 22nd and June 23rd, 2015.With more than 400 people on the wait list for both DockerCon 2014 and DockerCon Europe and due to popular demand, we decided to significantly increase the number of attendees to 2000 people.While we want to preserve the ambiance and simplicity of the first DockerCon, increasing the number of attendees, speakers and sponsors seems necessary to reflect Docker’s blooming ecosystem and community.The official website is still under construction as we are still working on DockerCon Europe, but today we can announce that the vast majority of the Docker team will be present as well as incredible speakers from the Docker community.</p>
