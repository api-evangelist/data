Sitting here, having made it through the holiday Eat-a-thon with nothing worse than a slight cold, and reviewing 2014, I feel that we’re looking back at a pretty momentous year in IT.I think it’s fair to say that, in Docker and, more generally, containers and microservices, we’re facing perhaps the greatest potential change in how we deliver and run software services since the arrival of virtual machines.Such a potential change naturally brings with it lots of interest and enthusiasm, and inevitably much hype and bandwagon-jumping too.</p>
