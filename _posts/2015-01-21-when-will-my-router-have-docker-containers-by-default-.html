This is something I’m working on building manually, but when will the wireless router for my home or business have Docker container support by default?I want to be able to deploy applications, and APIs either publicly or privately right on my own doorway to the Internet.This would take more work than just adding storage, compute, and Docker support at the router level.To enable this there would have to be changes at the network level, and is something I’m not sure telco and cable providers are willing to support.I’ll be researching this as a concept over the next couple months, so if you know of any read-to-go solutions, let me know.</p>
