<p>My goal for this guide is to show Internet marketers how they can use all of the various types of charts and graphs at their disposal to visualize their data and find actionable insights.I used Annie Cushing’s MozCon 2014 presentation and her Comprehensive Guide to Excel Charts for Marketers video, along with Microsoft’s guide for available charts in Excel to compile this manual.Column charts are best for data that is not continuous and is better shown separate.Bar charts work for the same situations as column charts, but should really only be used if axis labels are long.Line charts can show continuous data over time, so they’re ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, like months, or years.</p>
