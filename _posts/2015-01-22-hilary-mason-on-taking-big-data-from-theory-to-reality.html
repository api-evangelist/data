<p>If you’re interested in assessing how and when a given data technology — deep learning, machine intelligence, natural language generation — can move from the theoretical to commercial use,  Hilary Mason may have the best job around.This week’s guest, the CEO and Founder of Fast Forward Labs, talks about how that startup taps into a wide array of expertise sources– from academic and commercial research, the open source world to “outsider art” in the realms of spam and malware, to come up with new ideas for applications.One natural language generation (NLG) project, for example, lets a person who wants to sell her house, enter the parameters — square footage, number of rooms etc — then step back to let the system write up the ad for that property.(As a person who makes her living from writing words, all I can say is: “ick.”)
She’s also got an interesting take on opportunities in the internet of things — a term she dislikes — and why the much-maligned title of data scientist has validity.</p>
