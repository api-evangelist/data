<p>18th August 2014
New research suggests that only one in 100 cloud providers are completely prepared to meet the changes the new EU General Data Protection Regulation will demand from next year onwards.A study 7,000 cloud service providers - undertaken by cloud company Skyhigh Networks - revealed that just one per cent of the firms reviewed would be likely to comply with the proposed requirements.The new legislation, which could be passed this year and come into effect as early as 2015, has been created with the aims of modernising the current EU Data Protection Directive, which has been in force since 1995.New rules 
If passed, the EU General Data Protection Regulation will require data controllers (which refers to the organisation that owns the information) and data processors (any firm storing the data, such as cloud service providers and datacentres) to share the responsibility and legal liabilities for any incidents that involves a data breach or violation of the law.The yet-to-be passed legislation will have a wider scope compared to its predecessor as it would mean any data controller or processor located in the EU would be subject to the new regulations, regardless of whether the actual activity is carried out outside European territories.</p>
