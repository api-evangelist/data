<p>I have spent the last two days at a meeting run by the Automation and Analytical Management Group (AAMG) of the Royal Society of Chemistry. As well as being a lovely meeting location (the RSC building Burlington house isn’t your average conference centre- dessert was served in beakers and the rooms are beautiful) the meeting itself has been very interesting.With topics of talks ranging from new air quality monitoring techniques to the latest deployment of networks of sensors to exciting new citizen science projects and the future of air quality monitoring.The iSPEX add-on being used to measure aerosol properties
  It was this final topic that really caught my attention, a project called iSPEX originating in the Netherlands. iSPEX is an add-on for your iPhone which allows the user to take measurements of the properties of aerosols.</p>
