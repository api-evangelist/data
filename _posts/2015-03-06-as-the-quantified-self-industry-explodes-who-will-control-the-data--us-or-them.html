[Editor’s note: MyFitnessPal has just sold to UnderArmor, sales of Coke are down, and everything at CES was a wearable. Will data really make us less of a flabby, junk eating nation?In this Pando special series — Go On With Your Quantified Self — we’ll examine the promises and limits of the brave new world of “quantified self.”
The entire series is being sponsored by New Relic, so you’ll only see their ads around “Go On With Your Quantified Self” pieces.But the series was conceived, commissioned and edited entirely by Pando.</p>
