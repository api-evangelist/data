<p>Todays meeting of the Legislative Branch Bulk Data Task Force produced some major news.Specifically, there will be a lot of new bulk legislative data in the new year.The newly renamed Government Publishing Office (GPO) has been making bills from the House of Representatives available for bulk download in XML format for nearly two years.Now it appears the Senate will finally be joining the fun.Even better, both chambers are closer than ever to releasing bill status information in XML.</p>
